**3. Neural Network Scheme for Channel Coding** - `The entire channel coding block is to be replaced with a Neural Network.`

**4. Traffic Balancing While Maintaining Other KPIs: AN OPEN-ENDED INTELLIGENT SEARCH Approach** -  `Load/traffic balancing among radio Base Stations while maintaining different system KPIs (like optimal throughput, transmission of data using less power, etc.) is one of the major challenges facing mobile operators due to the uneven distribution of user equipment (UEs), dynamic nature of channel conditions, etc. For example, in 4G systems 15% of network cells carry 50% of mobile traffic.`

`Here we discuss, how traffic balancing can be performed for Aerial base stations (ABS, also known as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted base station (BS) ) using a form of deep reinforcement learning i.e. open-ended search. We start training agents on simpler environments with lesser UEs and lesser obstructions and gradually increase the complexity & come up with novel environments. There is also a cross pollination step where niche champions from different environment are tested on other environments to check their performance.`
